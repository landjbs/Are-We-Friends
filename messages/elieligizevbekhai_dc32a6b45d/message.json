I'm the public service chair for the Black Men's Forum, Vice President of Club Flag Football, and a writer for the Harvard Crimson.  I am also a member of Harvard College Faith and Action, a Christian group on campus that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a huge blessing in my life during my time at Harvard. I wanted to reach out to you to see if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything I can do to help make your transition into life at Harvard easier. If you have any questions about life on campus, anything related to extracurriculars or academics please let me know! I'd be more than happy to talk. If I can't answer your questions, I can link you with someone who would know more than me.  Hope to hear from you.\nJust to let you know too, HCFA is having a pizza party this Friday September 1st at 6 p.m. in Ticknor lounge in Boylston Hall.
